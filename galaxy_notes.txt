Hi Carl.

9:49
ceberhard
Heya. How's it going?
Sorry I missed you last week.

9:49
limax
Pretty good.

9:49
ceberhard
Was in a meeting.

9:49
limax
Oh.  It's alright.
So the context menus work now!  Thanks for recommending that JS module.

9:50
ceberhard
Oh. Cool!

9:50
limax
I have couple new questions for you.

9:50
ceberhard
Sure.

9:50
limax
So, my visualization is actually a pathway editor, right?

9:51
ceberhard
Ok.

9:51
limax
User uploads a pathway file.
Views the network graph in the visualization.
Edits the graph using the visualization.
Is there a way to output the new, edited graph in a file?

9:52
ceberhard
So:

9:52
limax
Do you kind of get what I'm talking about?

9:52
ceberhard
We've kind of taken the tack that visualizations (in general) shouldn't produce data.
IOW...

9:52
limax
oh.

9:53
ceberhard
Since they're not versioned or controlled on how they effect data - they're not reliable in a reproducibility chain.

9:54
limax
I wonder what is your recommendation for me, then.
Currently, I output the new graph as text in a text area.  User has to copy/paste into a new file for upload.

9:54
ceberhard
There are two ways you can still have it work (and, by all means, what you're lab/experiment/own priorities should guide you more than our feelings on it)
Right, so:
1) Trackster creates new datasets through the tool api
…it shows a change in the data directly in the visualization and then
…starts a tool that does the same effect with the proper parameters (AFAIK)
In your case, this prob. won't work because it's manual editing and
there's no way to create a tool that will do the same.
(programmitically)

9:57
limax
Yes, it is a manual process performed by (hopefully) an expert in the field.

9:57
ceberhard
2) You can post to the upload tool through the api (programmatically)
In this case, it's not reproducible, but if you're comfortable with that...
It will probably work.

9:59
limax
in method 2, the user can specify a name for the file, right?  It doesn't clobber anything right?

9:59
ceberhard
Yes (AFAIK) you can set the name, genome, etc. when POSTing to upload1

10:00
limax
Oh.  Okay, I think this is a possibility, then.  Is there documentation to help me figure out how to do this?

10:00
ceberhard
Not much, I'm afraid.
the url is POST api/tools/upload1

10:01
limax
Okay.  Then is there an example that I can look at?

10:01
ceberhard
You might check out Sam's stuff in galaxy.upload.js which posts to upload1

10:01
limax
Who is Sam?

10:02
ceberhard
Aysam Guerler (guerler) who works at Emory.
He's a UI guy as well now.

10:02
limax
Oh okay.  Was wondering if this is the same Sam that we have in our lab.

10:03
ceberhard
Associated code is in static/scripts/utils/galaxy.uploadbox.js
and api/tools.py
I'd recommend using jQuery for your AJAX (Sam creates his own XHR).
It's simpler.

10:05
limax
Okay, so I imagine that I would use jqery to post the file to the upload service along with file name, genome, etc… and then the new file should appear in user's history, right?

10:05
ceberhard
You would have to refresh the history as well.

10:06
limax
okay.  That doesn't seem too hard.  I hope it works!

10:06
ceberhard
You _should_ be able to do that by calling Galaxy.currHistoryPanel.refreshHdas()
Cool.
Me too.

10:06
limax
Thanks for the tips!

10:06
ceberhard
Sure.

10:06
limax
next question

10:06
ceberhard
Shoot.

10:07
limax
Right now my visualization accepts one file… the pathway file for viewing.

10:07
ceberhard
Ok.

10:07
limax
Is there a way for my visualization to take 2 or more files?

10:08
ceberhard
Not automatically (yet). It's def. something I'd like to do but involves some decisions.
I'd suggest adding UI to select a dataset from a list (like the history).
Or if it'll be required: a modal on the vis startup.

10:09
limax
I have a more advanced visualization that would require at least 2 files.

10:09
ceberhard
I'd recommend the modal on start up then.

10:10
limax
What do you mean by this?

10:10
ceberhard
A modal is a dialog box that prevents interaction with anything but it.
You can see one when you start trackster.
The code we use is galaxy.modal.js

10:11
limax
Yes, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'on start up'.

10:11
ceberhard
When your visualization first loads.

10:11
limax
Oh… okay.

10:11
ceberhard
Make sense?

10:12
limax
So the viz steals the focus from all other windows when it is started.

10:12
ceberhard
Essentially.
Are you familiar with dialog boxes?

10:13
limax
Yes, I am.

10:13
ceberhard
So - a dialog box appears with the visualization in the bg.
There is an element that acts like an overlay between the browser window (Galaxy, your vis) that blocks clicking and darkens the window a bit.

10:14
limax
I think I know what you're getting at… have a file-picking modal dialog box when the viz starts.

10:14
ceberhard
Over that is the dialog box that presents a list of datasets in the current history and asks the user to select the dataset.
Well - dataset picking - but yes.

10:15
limax
Is there documentation/example for this kind of dataset picking?

10:15
ceberhard
No, unfortunately.
There is an example in trackster you may be able to use.
You can see the functionality when you add a track or click 'add dataset'.

10:17
limax
Okay.  I'll look into it when I get a chance.  I think my next goal will be to upload edited pathway to user's history.
Thanks again for your help.

10:17
ceberhard
Cool.
It may be that we can add the dataset selection modal on our side to make that easier
(if we get time)

10:19
limax
Yes, I was a little bit hoping you guys might have a better way by the time I get to it.
Okay.  I've to get to the beach now.  Our lab is having an surfin' staches event to support Movember.

10:20
ceberhard
Nice!
Don't forget to get all the facial hair microbiome data afterward.

10:21
limax
10:21
blech!

10:21
ceberhard


10:21
limax
thanks again for your help.  ..and have a nice Thanksgiving.

10:21
ceberhard
You too!
