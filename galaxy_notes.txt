Hi Carl.

9:49
ceberhard
Heya. How's it going?
Sorry I missed you last week.

9:49
limax
Pretty good.

9:49
ceberhard
Was in a meeting.

9:49
limax
Oh.  It's alright.
So the context menus work now!  Thanks for recommending that JS module.

9:50
ceberhard
Oh. Cool!

9:50
limax
I have couple new questions for you.

9:50
ceberhard
Sure.

9:50
limax
So, my visualization is actually a pathway editor, right?

9:51
ceberhard
Ok.

9:51
limax
User uploads a pathway file.
Views the network graph in the visualization.
Edits the graph using the visualization.
Is there a way to output the new, edited graph in a file?

9:52
ceberhard
So:

9:52
limax
Do you kind of get what I'm talking about?

9:52
ceberhard
We've kind of taken the tack that visualizations (in general) shouldn't produce data.
IOW...

9:52
limax
oh.

9:53
ceberhard
Since they're not versioned or controlled on how they effect data - they're not reliable in a reproducibility chain.

9:54
limax
I wonder what is your recommendation for me, then.
Currently, I output the new graph as text in a text area.  User has to copy/paste into a new file for upload.

9:54
ceberhard
There are two ways you can still have it work (and, by all means, what you're lab/experiment/own priorities should guide you more than our feelings on it)
Right, so:
1) Trackster creates new datasets through the tool api
…it shows a change in the data directly in the visualization and then
…starts a tool that does the same effect with the proper parameters (AFAIK)
In your case, this prob. won't work because it's manual editing and
there's no way to create a tool that will do the same.
(programmitically)

9:57
limax
Yes, it is a manual process performed by (hopefully) an expert in the field.

9:57
ceberhard
2) You can post to the upload tool through the api (programmatically)
In this case, it's not reproducible, but if you're comfortable with that...
It will probably work.

9:59
limax
in method 2, the user can specify a name for the file, right?  It doesn't clobber anything right?

9:59
ceberhard
Yes (AFAIK) you can set the name, genome, etc. when POSTing to upload1

10:00
limax
Oh.  Okay, I think this is a possibility, then.  Is there documentation to help me figure out how to do this?

10:00
ceberhard
Not much, I'm afraid.
the url is POST api/tools/upload1

10:01
limax
Okay.  Then is there an example that I can look at?

10:01
ceberhard
You might check out Sam's stuff in galaxy.upload.js which posts to upload1

10:01
limax
Who is Sam?

10:02
ceberhard
Aysam Guerler (guerler) who works at Emory.
He's a UI guy as well now.

10:02
limax
Oh okay.  Was wondering if this is the same Sam that we have in our lab.

10:03
ceberhard
Associated code is in static/scripts/utils/galaxy.uploadbox.js
and api/tools.py
I'd recommend using jQuery for your AJAX (Sam creates his own XHR).
It's simpler.

10:05
limax
Okay, so I imagine that I would use jqery to post the file to the upload service along with file name, genome, etc… and then the new file should appear in user's history, right?

10:05
ceberhard
You would have to refresh the history as well.

10:06
limax
okay.  That doesn't seem too hard.  I hope it works!

10:06
ceberhard
You _should_ be able to do that by calling Galaxy.currHistoryPanel.refreshHdas()
Cool.
Me too.

10:06
limax
Thanks for the tips!

10:06
ceberhard
Sure.

10:06
limax
next question

10:06
ceberhard
Shoot.

10:07
limax
Right now my visualization accepts one file… the pathway file for viewing.

10:07
ceberhard
Ok.

10:07
limax
Is there a way for my visualization to take 2 or more files?

10:08
ceberhard
Not automatically (yet). It's def. something I'd like to do but involves some decisions.
I'd suggest adding UI to select a dataset from a list (like the history).
Or if it'll be required: a modal on the vis startup.

10:09
limax
I have a more advanced visualization that would require at least 2 files.

10:09
ceberhard
I'd recommend the modal on start up then.

10:10
limax
What do you mean by this?

10:10
ceberhard
A modal is a dialog box that prevents interaction with anything but it.
You can see one when you start trackster.
The code we use is galaxy.modal.js

10:11
limax
Yes, I'm not sure I understand what you mean by 'on start up'.

10:11
ceberhard
When your visualization first loads.

10:11
limax
Oh… okay.

10:11
ceberhard
Make sense?

10:12
limax
So the viz steals the focus from all other windows when it is started.

10:12
ceberhard
Essentially.
Are you familiar with dialog boxes?

10:13
limax
Yes, I am.

10:13
ceberhard
So - a dialog box appears with the visualization in the bg.
There is an element that acts like an overlay between the browser window (Galaxy, your vis) that blocks clicking and darkens the window a bit.

10:14
limax
I think I know what you're getting at… have a file-picking modal dialog box when the viz starts.

10:14
ceberhard
Over that is the dialog box that presents a list of datasets in the current history and asks the user to select the dataset.
Well - dataset picking - but yes.

10:15
limax
Is there documentation/example for this kind of dataset picking?

10:15
ceberhard
No, unfortunately.
There is an example in trackster you may be able to use.
You can see the functionality when you add a track or click 'add dataset'.

10:17
limax
Okay.  I'll look into it when I get a chance.  I think my next goal will be to upload edited pathway to user's history.
Thanks again for your help.

10:17
ceberhard
Cool.
It may be that we can add the dataset selection modal on our side to make that easier
(if we get time)

10:19
limax
Yes, I was a little bit hoping you guys might have a better way by the time I get to it.
Okay.  I've to get to the beach now.  Our lab is having an surfin' staches event to support Movember.

10:20
ceberhard
Nice!
Don't forget to get all the facial hair microbiome data afterward.

10:21
limax
10:21
blech!

10:21
ceberhard


10:21
limax
thanks again for your help.  ..and have a nice Thanksgiving.

10:21
ceberhard
You too!


1:10
limax
Hi Carl.  You recommended for me to talk to Sam Guerler about uploading a file to galaxy user's history.  Is 'guerler' his irc name?

1:10
ceberhard
Yep.
and hi

1:10
limax
Okay.  Thanks!

1:10
ceberhard
Sure!

1:11
limax
I'm going to ask him about this later today or tomorrow morning.

1:11
ceberhard
Ok. Sounds good.
How's the visualization?

1:13
limax
I have some other questions for you, actually.  I'll ask you after my meeting that I have right now.

1:14
ceberhard
Sure.
2:21
You have connected

2:21
limax
Hi Carl

2:22
ceberhard
Heya.

2:22
limax
I'm back from one meeting.

2:22
ceberhard
'one'
:)
When's the next?

2:23
limax
So, here's what I've noticed about the galaxy viz...

2:23
ceberhard
Ok. Shoot.

2:23
limax
The viz menu only appears for certain datatypes.
For example...
I can start my viz for sif file, but not tab file.

2:24
ceberhard
Right.
You're still using the config/graphview.xml file, correct?

2:24
limax
yes,  i am using a modified one.

2:24
ceberhard
Or a version copied using your name.
Ok.
Let me pull the original up quick.

2:25
limax
Is that where I can specify which datatypes can use limaxview?

2:25
ceberhard
Right.
So - for each* datatype you want to use with limaxview, you specify a datasource.
*and you can use the datatype hierarchy to add all children of a datatype.
err: make that a 'data_source'.

2:28
limax
hmmm….

2:28
ceberhard
Foresee some difficulties?

2:28
limax
what are the allowed values for datasource
i see graph.Rdf is allowed.  as is node-edge.
what other ones?

2:28
ceberhard
Well - for datatypes...
(and that's not the only test possible)

2:29
limax
For example, how can I add some generic tabbed file to the list?

2:29
ceberhard
any of the datatypes installed in your Galaxy installation.
So - scatterplot allows all tabular and descendant datatypes of tabular.
Check scatterplot.xml for that definition.

2:30
limax
Oh.  I'll take a look at that one.

2:30
ceberhard
"<test type="isinstance" test_attr="datatype" result_type="datatype">tabular.Tabular</test>"

2:31
limax
I should leave model_class unchanged, right?  use HistoryDatasetAssociation each time.

2:31
ceberhard
Right.
For right now - that's the only place you access visualizations - the history panel.
data_source basically asks the server:
is it an HDA? yes, then...
does it have a datatype of tabular? yes, then: provide a link.
(and convert the HDA into the url parameter dataset_id)

2:33
limax
Oh.  okay.  I understand it a little better now.  Link for the viz is only visible if the tests are all passed.
.. and each tag in the datasource is a kind of test.

2:34
ceberhard
Yep. _except_ 'if ANY of the tests are passed'.

2:34
limax
oh.

2:34
ceberhard
Right.

2:35
limax
so the tests are "or"-ed

2:35
ceberhard
Right.
So - you generally want to go from specific to general with data_sources.
I don't think you'll need to worry about that right now, tho.
Seems like you want to open up the possibilities.

2:37
limax
How do I interpret what tabular.Tabular means?  It looks like xx.yy format.
what is xx? and what is yy?

2:38
ceberhard
That's a bit of a remnant of python code unfortunately.
A couple of other 'tabular' classes are added dynamically during the datatype load.
'tabular.Tabular' specifies the datatypes/tabular module.
And then the Tabular class.

2:39
limax
oh.  ok.

2:39
ceberhard
Without that namespace 'tabular.', it could grab those 'other' Tabular classes.

2:40
limax
right.

2:40
ceberhard
A bit opaque, admittedly.

2:40
limax
it is to avoid namespace collision.

2:40
ceberhard
Had you seen this: http://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Documents/Presentations/GCC2013?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=EberhardCreateViz.pdf ?
Right.
Most of the content in the slides still applies.

2:41
limax
yes, I have seen it.  It didn't mean much to me at the time.  I should take a look at it again.  Thanks for reminding me about it.

2:41
ceberhard
2:41
Sure - it's not the best reference - but it might help show the possibilities.

2:51
limax
here's another problem with datatypes...

2:52
ceberhard
Ok.

2:52
limax
oh.  another meeting, sorry.

2:52
ceberhard
Ok. We can talk more tomorrow.
